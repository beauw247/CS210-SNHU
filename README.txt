This program analyzes item purchases from a grocery store log.

Menu Options:
1. Search for item frequency
2. Print all item frequencies
3. Print histogram of items

Input File: InputTextItemTracker.txt
Output Backup File: frequency.dat

Project Summary
Corner Grocer Item Tracker program that analyzes grocery purchase data. It reads a list of items and tracks how often they appear, and also lets users search for the frequencies, view puurchase data and display a histogram. It also will save backup data for future reference.
What did you do particularly well?
I wrote a clean and organized code with a structured class design. Nice user friendly menu and efficient processing.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I did struggle with the input text file. I did eventually figure it out. I know that once I am more seasoned I should be able to write more code with less entries and have a better idea of handling incorrect user input and diversifying the functions.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Inititally my struggle was the input file. I could have better logic I think but using maps was definitely better for retrieval.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I am now versed in file handling, class creation and creating user-friendly programs
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I created multiple files including .h and main.cpp and itemtrakcer.cpp I had good inline comments and also clear function names
